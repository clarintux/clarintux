I am an average user of the GNU/Linux operating system and free and open source programs since 2008.

I'm not a programmer or a computer scientist or a systems analyst. I'm just an amateur of this operating system, who enjoys tinkering with his PC.

For me GNU/Linux is like LEGO for a child: everyone can build everything to their liking, piece by piece. ðŸ˜„
